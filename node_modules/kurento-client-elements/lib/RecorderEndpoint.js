/**
 *
 * @classdesc
 *  Provides the functionality to store contents.
 *  <p>
 *    The recorder can store in local files or in a network resource. It 
 *    receives a
 *    media stream from another {@link module:core/abstracts.MediaElement 
 *    MediaElement} (i.e. the source), and
 *    stores it in the designated location.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *    The following information has to be provided in order to create a
 *    RecorderEndpoint, and cannot be changed afterwards:
 *  </p>
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>
 *      URI of the resource where media will be stored. Following schemas are
 *      supported:
 *      <ul>
 *        <li>
 *          Files: mounted in the local file system.
 *          <ul>
 *            <li><code>file:///path/to/file</code></li>
 *          </ul>
 *        </li>
 *        <li>
 *          HTTP: Requires the server to support method PUT
 *          <ul>
 *            <li><code>http(s)://{server-ip}/path/to/file</code></li>
 *            <li>
 *              <code>http(s)://username:password@{server-ip}/path/to/file</code>
 *            </li>
 *          </ul>
 *        </li>
 *      </ul>
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *      Relative URIs (with no schema) are supported. They are completed 
 *      prepending
 *      a default URI defined by property <i>defaultPath</i>. This property is
 *      defined in the configuration file
 *      <i>/etc/kurento/modules/kurento/UriEndpoint.conf.ini</i>, and the 
 *      default
 *      value is <code>file:///var/lib/kurento/</code>
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *      The media profile ({@link 
 *      module:elements.RecorderEndpoint#MediaProfileSpecType}) used to store 
 *      the file.
 *      This will determine the encoding. See below for more details about media
 *      profile.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *      Optionally, the user can select if the endpoint will stop processing 
 *      once
 *      the EndOfStream event is detected.
 *    </li>
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *    RecorderEndpoint requires access to the resource where stream is going to 
 *    be
 *    recorded. If it's a local file (<code>file://</code>), the system user 
 *    running
 *    the media server daemon (kurento by default), needs to have write 
 *    permissions
 *    for that URI. If it's an HTTP server, it must be accessible from the 
 *    machine
 *    where media server is running, and also have the correct access rights.
 *    Otherwise, the media server won't be able to store any information, and an
 *    {@link ErrorEvent} will be fired. Please note that if you haven't 
 *    subscribed to
 *    that type of event, you can be left wondering why your media is not being
 *    saved, while the error message was ignored.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *    The media profile is quite an important parameter, as it will determine
 *    whether the server needs to perform on-the-fly transcoding of the media. 
 *    If
 *    the input stream codec if not compatible with the selected media profile, 
 *    the
 *    media will be transcoded into a suitable format. This will result in a 
 *    higher
 *    CPU load and will impact overall performance of the media server.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *    For example: Say that your pipeline will receive <b>VP8</b>-encoded video 
 *    from
 *    WebRTC, and sends it to a RecorderEndpoint; depending on the format
 *    selected...
 *  </p>
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>
 *      WEBM: The input codec is the same as the recording format, so no 
 *      transcoding
 *      will take place.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *      MP4: The media server will have to transcode from <b>VP8</b> to 
 *      <b>H264</b>.
 *      This will raise the CPU load in the system.
 *    </li>
 *    <li>
 *      MKV: Again, video must be transcoded from <b>VP8</b> to <b>H264</b>, 
 *      which
 *      means more CPU load.
 *    </li>
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *    From this you can see how selecting the correct format for your 
 *    application is
 *    a very important decision.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *    Recording will start as soon as the user invokes the record method. The
 *    recorder will then store, in the location indicated, the media that the 
 *    source
 *    is sending to the endpoint's sink. If no media is being received, or no
 *    endpoint has been connected, then the destination will be empty. The 
 *    recorder
 *    starts storing information into the file as soon as it gets it.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *    When another endpoint is connected to the recorder, by default both AUDIO 
 *    and
 *    VIDEO media types are expected, unless specified otherwise when invoking 
 *    the
 *    connect method. Failing to provide both types, will result in teh 
 *    recording
 *    buffering the received media: it won't be written to the file until the
 *    recording is stopped. This is due to the recorder waiting for the other 
 *    type
 *    of media to arrive, so they are synchronized.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *    The source endpoint can be hot-swapped, while the recording is taking 
 *    place.
 *    The recorded file will then contain different feeds. When switching video
 *    sources, if the new video has different size, the recorder will retain the
 *    size of the previous source. If the source is disconnected, the last frame
 *    recorded will be shown for the duration of the disconnection, or until the
 *    recording is stopped.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *    It is recommended to start recording only after media arrives, either to 
 *    the
 *    endpoint that is the source of the media connected to the recorder, to the
 *    recorder itself, or both. Users may use the MediaFlowIn and MediaFlowOut
 *    events, and synchronize the recording with the moment media comes in. In 
 *    any
 *    case, nothing will be stored in the file until the first media packets 
 *    arrive.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *    Stopping the recording process is done through the stopAndWait method, 
 *    which
 *    will return only after all the information was stored correctly. If the 
 *    file
 *    is empty, this means that no media arrived at the recorder.
